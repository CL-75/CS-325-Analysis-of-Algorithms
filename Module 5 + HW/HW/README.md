Files for CS325 - HW5
There is one program:
One named "wrestlers.py" that takes in data from a file given by the user and outputs the proper sorted data to the terminal
Files are found in levyca's flip1 files, ~/CS325/HW5

Below are the instructions to run the program after accessing OSU's server "flip":

to run the wrestlers program, enter "python3 wrestlers.py"

Sample files to test the program are included in my directory labeled "HW5"
   "wrestlers_2.txt"
   "wrestlers_3.txt"
