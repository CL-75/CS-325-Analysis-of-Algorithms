Files for CS325 - HW3
There is one program:
One named "shopping.py" that writes data to a file containing the maximum total price of items
 for each family and the items that each family member should select for a family who has won 
 a shopping spree.
Files are found in levyca's flip1 files, ~/CS325/HW3

Below are the instructions to run the program after accessing OSU's server "flip":
