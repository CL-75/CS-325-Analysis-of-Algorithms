Files for CS325 - HW2
There are two total programs:
One named "stoogeSort" that takes in a data.txt file and sorts the data within and writes this sorted data to another file.
One named "stoogeTime" that creates arrays of different sizes, sorts them, then displays the time taken to complete the array.
Files are found in levyca's flip1 files, ~/CS325/HW2

Below are the instructions to run the programs after accessing OSU's server "flip":
To run the Stooge Sort program, enter "python3 stoogeSort.py"
To run the Stooge Time program, enter "python3 stoogeTime.py"
