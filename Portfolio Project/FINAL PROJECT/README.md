GOAL: Solve the Sudoku board!
You are given a 9x9 board that is broken up into 9 smaller sections of size 3x3 each. Your 
task is to place numbers 1-9 in each of these sections without repeating numbers. You also
cannot repeat any numbers in any rows or columns as well. You win the game when every column, row, 
and 3x3 section contains only one usage of each number from 1 to 9. The game will begin with some boxes pre-filled
for you. Use these to your advantage!
